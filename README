# Gorkana Calculator v.0.1.0 #

## Installation ##
Download the files and install the package using composer's install tool.
```bash
$ php composer.phar install
```
This will automatically download all dependencies of the package.

## Usage ##
The calculator currently can be run only from the command line interface.

Navigate to the project's root folder, e.g.
```bash
$ cd /home/my_user/gorkana/calculator/
```
and execute the ```index.php``` with PHP like this:
```bash
$ php index.php help calculate
```
This will show the command line tool's available options.
The ```calculate``` command supports as an argument the ```file``` from there the instructions will be read.
Make sure the instructions file is exists and is readable, otherwise you will get an error message.
The ```help``` will specify the possible calculations that can be executed:
```apply, add, subtract, multiply, divide```

This package already has in it's root folder 5 examples of instruction files, using one of those would be
to run the following command:
```bash
$ php index.php calculate example.txt
```
This will output the result of the mathematical instructions read from the file ```example.txt``` and will
print ```15``` as the output.
